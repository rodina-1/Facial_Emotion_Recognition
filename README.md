Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a computer vision task that aims to classify human facial expressions into predefined emotion categories.  
This project compares **basic CNN models** with an advanced **Swin Transformer** architecture, showing a significant improvement in accuracy and robustness.  
The final deployed model is based on **Swin Transformer**, due to its superior performance on the RAF-DB dataset.

##  **Project Description**

This project focuses on classifying facial expressions into **seven emotion categories**:(0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral)


We developed and compared two models:

- **Baseline CNN** → helped understand dataset behavior but achieved limited accuracy (~62%).  
- **Swin Transformer** → significantly improved performance and became the final chosen model.

The project includes:

- Full EDA  
- Preprocessing & Data Augmentation  
- Model training & validation  
- Evaluation metrics  
- Explainability using **Grad-CAM**  
- GUI deployment using **Streamlit**

##  **Dataset**

- **Source:** RAF-DB (Kaggle)  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013  
- **Image size:** 48×48 grayscale  
- **Train size:** 12,271 images  
- **Test size:** 3,068 images  
- **Dataset notes:**  
  - Faces are centered and pre-aligned  
  - Class distribution is imbalanced (Happy is dominant)

##  **Project Pipeline**
Data Loading → Preprocessing → Augmentation → Model Training (CNN/Swin) → Evaluation → Grad-CAM → Deployment (Streamlit GUI)

##  **Preprocessing**

Using `torchvision.transforms`:

python
train_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Grayscale(num_output_channels=1),
    transforms.Resize((48, 48)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.RandomRotation(10),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize([0.5], [0.5])
])

test_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Grayscale(num_output_channels=1),
    transforms.Resize((48, 48)),
    ToTensor(),
    Normalize([0.5], [0.5])
])
✔ Normalization
✔ Data Augmentation
✔ Grayscale conversion
✔ Image resizing

##  **Model Architectures**
1️⃣ Baseline CNN (Initial Experiment)

**Simple convolutional layers**
**ReLU activation**
**MaxPooling**
**Fully connected head**
**Achieved ~62% accuracy**

->The CNN served as a baseline but didn’t generalize well due to dataset complexity.

2️⃣ Swin Transformer (Final Model)

Swin Transformer introduces:
✔ Hierarchical representation
✔ Shifted window mechanism
✔ Strong performance on image classification tasks
✔ Better handling of spatial dependencies

->This model dramatically improved accuracy and per-class metrics.

##  **Training Setup**

Epochs: 60
Batch size: 64
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: CrossEntropyLoss
Scheduler: (if used)
Early Stopping: patience = 10
Checkpointing: every 5 epochs
Hardware: NVIDIA T4 GPU

## **Results**

Most Confused Emotion Pairs

Happy → Neutral : 47
Neutral → Sad : 46
Sad → Neutral : 38
Disgust → Neutral : 20

## **Confusion Matrix & Explainability**

We generated:

✔ Confusion Matrix
✔ Grad-CAM heatmaps
→ Showing which facial regions the model focuses on when predicting emotions.

This enhances model interpretability and supports academic discussion.
