Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a computer vision task that aims to classify human facial expressions into predefined emotion categories.  
This project compares **basic CNN models** with an advanced **Swin Transformer** architecture, showing a significant improvement in accuracy and robustness.  
The final deployed model is based on **Swin Transformer**, due to its superior performance on the RAF-DB dataset.

##  **Project Description**

This project focuses on classifying facial expressions into **seven emotion categories**:(0= 'angry',1= 'disgust', 2= 'fear', 3= 'happy', 4= 'neutral', 5= 'sad', 6= 'surprise')


We developed and compared two models:

- **Baseline CNN** → helped understand dataset behavior but achieved limited accuracy (~74.5%).  
- **Swin Transformer** → significantly improved performance and became the final chosen model.

The project includes:

- Full EDA  
- Preprocessing & Data Augmentation  
- Model training & validation  
- Evaluation metrics  
- GUI deployment using **Streamlit**

##  **Dataset**

- **Source:** Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset (Kaggle)  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahadullaha/facial-emotion-recognition-dataset  
- **Image size:** 96*96 RGB  
- **Train size:** 34844 image (70.0%)
- **Validation size:**  7467 image (15.0%) 
- **Test size:** 7468 image (15.0%)  
- **Dataset notes:**  
  - Faces are centered and pre-aligned  
  - Class distribution is imbalanced (Happy is dominant)

##  **Project Pipeline**
Data Loading → Preprocessing → Augmentation → Model Training (CNN/Swin) → Evaluation  → Deployment (Streamlit GUI)

##  **Preprocessing**
For CNN
Using `torchvision.transforms`:

python
train_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((96, 96)),
    transforms.Grayscale(num_output_channels=3),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                         std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])


# Validation & Test transforms (without augmentation)
val_test_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((96, 96)),
    transforms.Grayscale(num_output_channels=3), 
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

✔ Normalization

✔ Data Augmentation

✔ Grayscale conversion

✔ Image resizing

##  **Model Architectures**

1️⃣ Baseline CNN (Initial Experiment)

-Simple convolutional layers

-ReLU activation

-MaxPooling

-Fully connected head

-Achieved ~74.5% accuracy

->The CNN served as a baseline but didn’t generalize well due to dataset complexity.

2️⃣ Swin Transformer (Final Model)

Swin Transformer introduces:

✔ Hierarchical representation

✔ Shifted window mechanism

✔ Strong performance on image classification tasks

✔ Better handling of spatial dependencies

->This model dramatically improved accuracy and per-class metrics.
